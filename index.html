      A convention, in the sense of a meeting, is a gathering of individuals who
      meet at an arranged place and time in order to discuss or engage in some
      common interest. The most common conventions are based upon industry,
      profession, and fandom. Trade conventions typically focus on a particular
      industry or industry segment, and feature keynote speakers, vendor
      displays, and other information and activities of interest to the event
      organizers and attendees. Professional conventions focus on issues of
      concern along with advancements related to the profession. Such
      conventions are generally organized by societies or communities dedicated
      to promotion of the topic of interest. Fan conventions usually feature
      displays, shows, and sales based on pop culture and guest celebrities.
      Science fiction conventions traditionally partake of the nature of both
      professional conventions and fan conventions, with the balance varying
      from one to another. Conventions also exist for various hobbies, such as
      gaming or model railroads.
